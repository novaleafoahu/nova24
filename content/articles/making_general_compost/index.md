## ðŸ’¡Introduction
This article will provide a brief overview of compost and making compost.


## What is compost and what is it used for?
Compost, in the most basic sense is made up of decomposed organic matter. The organic matter can come from many different things. The most readily available inputs we use include:

    * Fallen leaves, especially during Fall leaf cleanup
    * Vegatable kitchen scraps
    * Weeds, Grass, dead plants
    * Coffee grounds (did you know starbucks can provide spent coffee grounds for free?)
    * Manure from vegable eating animals (Horse, Cow, Pig, Rabbit)
    * Shreaded paper/cardboard

When the compost is ready, it can be spread and mixed into garden plots and/or included into potted plants. Compost provides some nutrients, improves the soil with beneficial organisms, and also inprovides the soil's water retention and drainage.   

**How much nutrients does compost provide?**

It depends on the inputs. Manure provides the highest levels of nitrogen, vegetables like banana peels provide some source of potassium. For example, see the table below for nitrogen contents of different inputs:

| Materials High in Nitrogen   | Carbon : Nitrogen ratio |
|----------|:-------------:|
| vegetable scraps |  15-20:1 | 
|coffee grounds |   20 : 1   | 
| grass clippings | 15-25:1 |
| manure | 5-25: 1 |

**What do these values mean?**

It means you need hundreds of manure lbs to produce 1 lb of nitrogen. Typically, for 1 acre of land, it has been said by University of Georgia Agriculture, that 120 lbs each of NPK will provide enough nutrients for most crops to produce commerical yields. 

Therfore quick math:

1 acre = 43560 Square Feet (SF)

120lbs / 43560 SF = ~.003 lbs per SF. 

.003 lbs = 1.36 grams

500 SF garden plot = 680 grams or 1.5 lbs of fertilizer

## Getting started
The best time for us to start a compost pile is towards the end of summer/beginning of fall when leaves start to fall for collection. Summer plants are done producing and can be pulled from the ground and added to the pile. As provided below, we are looking to get **30 parts brown leaves to 1 part greens for nitrogren (in volume)** (green plants, coffee grounds, grass clippings, manure). We want enough material to create a layered (browns + greens/manure) 3' x 3' x 3' cube/pile.

>To provide optimal amounts of these two crucial elements, you can use the carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio for each of
>your compost ingredients. The ideal C/N ratio for composting is generally considered to be around 30:1, or 30 parts 
>carbon for each part nitrogen by weight. Why 30:1? At lower ratios, nitrogen will be supplied in excess and will be lost
>as ammonia gas, causing undesirable odors. Higher ratios mean that there is not sufficient nitrogen for optimal growth 
>of the microbial populations, so the compost will remain relatively cool and degradation will proceed at a slow rate.


## Make the pile
See picture below. We like to layer alternating browns and greens to make the compost pile. With each layer, add some water. This wil create a nice environment for the organisms. Organisims will then begin to break down the organic material generating heat from 120 to 170 degrees fahrenheit.

## The waiting game
A compost pile can take 1-2 years to break down without further effort. However, to speed up the process, one can do a few things...

1. Shread the material via leaf cutter, lawn mower
2. Keep the compost pile moist
3. Turn the compost pile. This means, mix the pile where the center of the pile changes position with the contents of the outer pile.
