&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nova Leaf was establised in 2023. We are avid home gardners located in southern NJ. We have grown many different 🍉fruits, 🥬vegetables, 🌻flowers, 🍃herbs, and 🌱plants. Through out this journey, we learned many things about growing plants.  



&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We hope to share information about our experiments, what we have learned, tools, and fertilizers to help those who also want to grow 🍆🥦🥒🍇 in thier backyard.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We  have plans to provide organic fertilizers, soil mixes, seeds, and vermicompost. 


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please check out our articles, products, and etsy store. If you have any questions, contact us at our email listed on the contact page.
